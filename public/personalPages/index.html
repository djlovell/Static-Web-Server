                Hello, and welcome to my personal page! My name is Danny and I am
                a senior at Kansas State University graduating this May with my
                Computer Engineering Degree. I grew up in the Overland Park/Olathe
                area outside of Kansas City, where I lived with my Mom and pet Miniature
                Schnauzer, Woody. After graduating from Blue Valley West High School in 
                2014, I followed in the path of much of my family and became a Wildcat. 
                Always a fan of Jazz, BBQ, and everything else Kansas City, I'm looking
                forward to returning to work at Garmin International as a Software Engineer
                after graduation!

                Since purchasing my first smartphone, the original Galaxy S, in 2010
                and becoming a de facto Android enthusiast, I was destined to graviate 
                towards the tech industry, whether I knew it at the time or not. At K-State,
                the core programming courses quickly became my favorite, despite the
                electrical/embedded hardware focus of my degree. My dream was to work at a large
                technology company, developing software at the system or application
                level for consumer electronics, such as smartphones or IOT devices. 
                When I was hired at Garmin as an intern in 2017, I started developing for 
                Avionics Displays as part of a User Interface team. Both Aviation and
                strict C development were largely unfamilar to me, but have been both fascinating
                and enjoyable to learn about. With plans to continue my role full time, I've used
                design classes and my remaining electives to reaquaint myself with Java 
                development, and diversify in areas such as web development and microcomputer system 
                design.

                Outside of my classes and engineering work, I am heavily involved in both
                the College of Engineering and the Music Department. I have enjoyed serving
                as an Engineering Ambassador, representing STEM, K-State, and our
                programs and facilities with future students on campus and at state-wide
                events, and am also active in K-State's chapter of Tau Beta Pi Engineering 
                Honor Society. I just finished up my 4th and final season with the Pride
                of Wildcat Land Marching Band, and still play trombone in the Concert Jazz
                Ensemble. As a former Boy Scout, when I have opportunites to travel, I enjoy 
                skiing, hiking, and camping, particularly in Colorado or Utah. At home, hiking
                the scenic Konza Prairie is one of my favorite activities!
