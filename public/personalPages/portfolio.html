                <h3>S08 Microcontroller Implementation</h3>
                <p>As a part of my final Computer Engineering Design Lab, I implemented
                   a working version of the Freescale HCS08 Microcontroller's instruction
                   set, with a floating point unit cabable of performing multiplication and
                   division, from scratch. The end product, simulated on an Altera FPGA, was
                   capable of executing a simple responsive console application, in addition
                   to floating point arithmatic. In total, Register Transfer statements for 
                   29 CPU instructions were developed.

                <h3>Marching Band Light Show System</h3>
                <p>For my Senior Design Project, I worked as a part of a team in collaboration
                   with the nationally acclaimed Kansas State Marching Band to create an LED
                   Light Show system, mountable on each member's helmet and both programmed
                   and controlled wirelessly by laptop. I designed and implemented the cross-
                   platform control software, and assisted in programming and interfacing with
                   the Arudinos that controlled the LED units and the wireless network chips. 
                   5 working units were breadboarded and demonstrated by the end of the semester, 
                   the first visible progress on the project in its 2 year history.

                <h3>Engineering Ambassador Event Reminder</h3>
                <p>In order to gain a practical introduction to both Python and the fundamentals 
                   of Web Page design, I created a web-scraper that would parse the contents of
                   the K-State Engineering Ambassadors website, which I had login access to
                   as a member (no hacking was needed!). The scraper extracted information about
                   upcoming recruiting events available for sign-up, and sent a formatted email
                   to the organization's members so that they could more easily stay up to date
                   on which events still needed assistance.
